        Combo:
          BlastJump:
            Description: Airbenders can easily make jumps forward from the ground
              or air!
            Instructions: (HoldSneak) -> AirBlast(Release Sneak)
          SuctionJump:
            Description: Airbenders can easily make jumps backward from the ground
              or air!
            Instructions: (HoldSneak) -> AirSuction(Release Sneak)
      Earth:
        Combo:
          ShakingOffLava:
            Description: Shake off the flames with a protective layer of earth on
              your body, turning it into lava and spewing out to the sides around
              you, transferring the fire ticks to others!
            Instructions: (Tap Shift)
      Fire:
        Combustion:
          Description: Combustionbending is a form of telekinetic firebending. It
            consists of the ability to channel chi through the forehead, often marked
            by an intricate third-eye tattoo, superheating the surrounding air and
            producing a beam of explosive energy capable of immense damage, both in
            short and long range. Unlike conventional firebending, which produces
            a flame from the body, the technique instead creates a powerful beam that
            explodes upon contact with a solid surface.
          Instructions: Hold sneak and look on chargebar. Release sneak to launch
            beam. When ability is charged, you can charge it more, to get more control
            on the beam, but if you'll be damaged while charging, you will explode
            yourself.

        Combo:

            Instructions: Return to "PhaseChange" while casting Rainbending combo
              and activate it.
          Rainbending:
            Description: As Hama has demonstrated, waterbenders are capable of drawing
              water directly from the air. If it's raining, getting water becomes
              even easier.
            Instructions: PhaseChange(Release Sneak) -> PhaseChange(Hold Sneak) ->
              Choose ability and collect water -> Follow the instructions in the ChargeBar
              (Be careful not to shake the camera in the last step)
  xNuminousx:

      Description: Chiblockers are skilled acrobats and this HighJump Replacement

        a double jump, or use the classic HighJump if you so desire!
      Instructions: 'Left-Click: Jump up. Tap-Shift: Lunge backwards. Spint+Click:
        Lunge Forwards. Tap-Shift in the air: Double Jump'

      FireJet:
        Description: This ability provides a firebender with great mobility and repositioning
          options. This move has 2 use with their own cooldowns.
        Instructions: |2-

          Jet: This function allows a firebender to fly using jets of fire. To use, hold shift. A bar will appear at the top of your screen to show charging progress. At any point you can let go to start the move. The fuller the bar, the faster and longer you will fly. Switching slots during flight does not cancel the move, but instead locks the direction. Making turns during flight is limited to a certain angle.
          Dash: This function allows a firebender to make a single large jump in a direction. To do this, simply left click. Shortly after activating this and while still in the air, you may hold shift. When you do this, you start surfing across the ground for a longer period of time. Changing slots is also possible during this, and will also lock your direction. However, you must hold shift, or this move will stop.
      Combo:
        BlazeTrail:
          Description: With this combo, a firebender can use their FireSki to set
            the ground on fire. To use this combo, tap shift on FireBlast twice. Then,
            start skiing.
          Instructions: FireBlast (Tap Shift) > FireBlast (Tap Shift) > FireJet (Left
            Click) > FireJet (Shift Down)
        FireStomp:
          Description: This combo allows a firebender to perform a downward kick,
            striking fire around them when hitting the ground. To use, perform the
            combo. You then have 1.5 seconds to hit the ground at high enough velocity.
            When you do so, fire will strike on the impact area, knocking back and
            damaging those around you, as well as reducing your fall damage.
          Instructions: Blaze (Shift Down) > Blaze (Left Click) > Blaze (Shift Up)
        FlameRush:
          Description: With this combo, a firebender can greatly accelerate their
            FireJet, at the cost of steering capacity. To use, the FireJet charge
            bar must be charged to red. When activated, your FireJet will become much
            faster and knock aside anyone you hit. However, steering becomes nearly
            impossible.
          Instructions: Blaze (Shift Down) > FireBlast (Shift Up) > FireJet (Tap Shift)
      Passive:
        FireCushion:
          Description: By firebending from their feet, firebenders can break their
            own fall. When you take fall damage, the damage is automatically reduced
            by a few hearts.

    Elements:

      Air: |-
        Air is the element of freedom. Airbenders are natural pacifists and great explorers. There is nothing stopping them from scaling the tallest mountains and walls easily. They specialize in redirection, from blasting things away with gusts of winds, to forming a shield around them to prevent damage. Easy to get across flat terrains, such as oceans, there is practically no terrain off limits to Airbenders. They lack much raw damage output, but make up for it with with their ridiculous amounts of utility and speed.
        Enter /b display Air for a list of the available air abilities.
      Water: |-
        Water is the element of change. Waterbending focuses on using your opponents own force against them. Using redirection and various dodging tactics, you can be made practically untouchable by an opponent. Waterbending provides agility, along with strong offensive skills while in or near water.
        Enter /b display Water for a list of the available water abilities.
      Earth: |-
        Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders share many of the same fundamental techniques as Waterbenders, but their domain is quite different and more readily accessible. Earthbenders dominate the ground and subterranean, having abilities to pull columns of rock straight up from the earth or drill their way through the mountain. They can also launch themselves through the air using pillars of rock, and will not hurt themselves assuming they land on something they can bend. The more skilled Earthbenders can even bend metal, sand, and lava.
        Enter /b display Earth for a list of the available earth abilities.
      Fire: |-
        Fire is the element of power. Firebenders focus on destruction and incineration. Their abilities are pretty straight forward: set things on fire. They do have a bit of utility however, being able to make themselves un-ignitable, extinguish large areas, cook food in their hands, extinguish large areas, small bursts of flight, and then comes the abilities to shoot fire from your hands.
        Enter /b display Fire for a list of the available fire abilities.
      Chi: |-
        Chiblockers focus on bare handed combat, utilizing their agility and speed to stop any bender right in their path. Although they lack the ability to bend any of the other elements, they are great in combat, and a serious threat to any bender. Chiblocking was first shown to be used by Ty Lee in Avatar: The Last Airbender, then later by members of the Equalists in The Legend of Korra.
        Enter /b display Chi for a list of the available chi abilities.
      Avatar: |-
        Avatars are the human embodiment of light and peace created through a connection with the Avatar Spirit. It is considered an Avatar's duty to master the four elements and use that power to keep balance among the four nations as well as act as the bridge between the physical and spiritual worlds.
