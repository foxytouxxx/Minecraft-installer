Note: 'MaxPotential is used as a base for the algorithm. It adds up the total of the
  highest armor power and uses that as the max potential power. Be sure when you add
  up the totals of all pieces in an armor set.To check: Helmet + Chestplate + Leggings
  + Boots = Total Armor Power. Example (Netherite armor): Helmet + Chestplate + Leggings
  + Boots = 20'
Note 2: The GlobalStrength variable is a means of having control over the armors strength
  all at once. For example, by setting the GlobalStrength to 1 someone with full diamond
  armor will not take any damage from a bending ability. It's set to 0.6 by default
  so only 60 percent of the damage reduction actually takes place. This value should
  not be more than 1 or less than 0 since it's on a percentage calculation where 1
  = 100%, 0.5 = 50%, and 0 = 0%.
